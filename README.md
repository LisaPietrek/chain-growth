# Hierarchical chain growth
Grow ensembles of disordered biomolecules from fragment libraries

## Overview
Algorithm to assemble full-length chains of disordered proteins and regions from short overlapping fragments [1]. 

As input to perform the hierarchical chain growth (HCG) you need the sequence of the desired IDP and provide a fragment
library. Fragment libraries are typically generated by molecular dynamics simulations. Experimental information on local 
conformations can be used to improve the quality of ensembles in reweighted hierarchical chain growth (RHCG) [2],
which have used to study tau K18. 

In the examples folder we use a truncated protein sequence of tau K18 to keep file sizes managable. We provide
fragment libraries for this truncated sequence and example scripts to run HCG and RHCG.

## Installation

Example installation in a new conda enviornment 

```bash
conda create -n hcg_py3.7 python=3.7
conda activate hcg_py3.7
git clone https://github.com/bio-phys/hierarchical-chain-growth.git
cd hierarchical-chain-growth
pip install -e . 
```

Python 3.6+ is required. 

## Inputs
- The sequence or topology file of the desired IDP/IDR as .fasta or .pdb, respectively. If you use .fasta make sure the fasta file contains a "header" beginning with ">".
- A MD fragment library. You may prepare the library following the examples given in this repository.
- If you want to perform RHCG: weights for the individual fragments (e.g., from ensemble reweighting against experimental data reporting on _local_ structure properties - such as chemical shifts)

## Example truncated tauK18
### Prepare fragments
- Use amber tleap to generate (end-capped) fragments of desired length and with desired overlap.
- For "prepare_fragment_list_tleap.py" you need as input a .fasta or .pdb file to get the sequence of the IDP/IDR you want to grow.
- The script outputs a .txt file containint all the fragment sequences that you need to generate using tleap .
	- The output .txt file can be used as input for tleap.
- Here we show the procedure using the sequence of a truncated tauK18 as input (in form of a fasta file)

### Run molecular dynamics simulations of the fragments

We have used replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations to extensively sample conformations for each fragments.

### Refine fragment ensembles with experimental data

In Ref [2] we show how to refine fragment ensembles with experimental data. The refined fragment ensembles can be used
for chain growth in an importance sampling framework. The BioEn package can be used to refine fragment ensembles.

### Run chain growth
The files "run_hcg.py" and "run_rhcg.py" show how to run HCG or RHCG for a truncated tau K18. These are simple Python scripts that
can be executed on the command line or submitted to a HPC cluster. Comments in "hcg_fct.py" provide a explanation
to different parameters that one can set for running chain growth and we refer to Ref 1 for more detailled discussions.
